A paragraph is a distinct section of writing that focuses on a single idea or topic, typically consisting of several related sentences. It is structured with a topic sentence, supporting sentences that provide details or examples, and often a concluding sentence that wraps up the idea. Paragraphs help organize a text, guide the reader, and are indicated by an indentation or a new line.
